My solutions in Clojure for [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017)

## Usage

The easiest way is to run this with `lein run`. Provide the day of the
puzzle which should be solved as a parameter and the puzzle input on
stdin:

    $ lein run 1 <test/resources/day1-input.txt

### Note

This is not necessarily idiomatic Clojure since I use the chance to
try out different features of the language and of the leiningen build
tool.
